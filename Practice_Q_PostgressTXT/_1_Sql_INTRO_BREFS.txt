1) what is SQL ?

SQL is a Structured Query Language that use to interact with database .


2) what is the purpose of SQL ?

The purpose of SQL is to Create, Read/Retrieved, Update and delete the data 

3) What is database ?

Database is a system that  use to store, manipulate, organize and help to access the data .
Database contain Many different type of data in the from of table (Row and Column)
There are two type of Database Relational and Non-Relational proposed by EF code in 1980 .
The structure of Relational database  is use to store data in the from of table (row and column)
The structure of Non-Relational database is use to store data in the from of key-value .

4) When we not use Excel to store data for Database?

We use Excel for Small amount of data.
We use Excel for one time analysis
We use Excel for Quick Chart/Graph
 

5) when we use  like SQL ?

We use SQL to store large amount of Data
we use SQL to Store Real time Data From Website/App
We use SQL because easily combined with Different Dataset
We use SQL Because It is Easy and safe access 
We use SQL because provide Data Integrity
We use SQL because data Integrity 
 

6) There are so many platform that use to interact with SQL ? 
 
MySQL
SQL Server
SQLite
PostgreSQL
ORACLE PL/SQL
Snowflake
amazon REDSIFT



7) What is Query ?

In SQL, a query is a request for data or information from a database means asking a question 
to the database, and the database responds with the requested information


8) What is clause ?                                                           

It is a part of a query that specifies a particular condition or operation. 
It used to define how data should be filtered, grouped, sorted, or manipulated. 
Common SQL clause are : - FROM, WHERE, SELECT, HAVING, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOIN .

> when space is given between the name. then use double Quote .
  
  syntax : -
  
  CREATE DATABASE  YourDatabaseName;
  CREATE DATABASE  "Your DatabaseName";
  


> Ones we have a database Then we create table within it .
> Table store structured data and consist of column(fields) and row(records) 
> CREATE TABLE command is use to create table 
> Each table contain row(record) and column(fields) along with their datatype
> Each column of the table written under the small parenthesis
	
  Syntax :  -
  
  CREATE TABLE YourTableName (
	
	column1 datatype
	column2 datatype
	column3 datatype
	.....
	
	);

  SQL OPERATORS  : -
  
  > Operators are symboll or keyword that use to perform operations on data in database

  > Other operators (IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL) _____________ Dfferent Keyword perform different operation 
  
  Note : -
  
  (=) single equal sign is use for Comparision in SQL but in other language we use double . 
  (+) is use for Concatenation and addition in the case of string or integer    
  UNION is use to Combines the results of two queries and removes duplicates
  UNION ALL is use to Combines the results of two queries including duplicates
  INTERSECT is use to returns common records from two queries
  EXCEPT is use to returns records from the first query that are not in the second query
  WHERE clause used to filter records in a SQL query 
  
  
  Syntax : -
  
  Logical operator : -
  
  SLECT column1 FROM YourTableName

  DELETE : - 
  
  > DELETE command is used to remove one or more existing rows from a table 
  > WHERE (condition) clause or keyword is necessary to use with DELETE command 
    if we not use condition then all records are delete

  
  - Effect: The table structure remains intact; only the data (rows) are removed.
  - Can Use WHERE Clause: Yes — allows selective deletion.
  - Rollback: Possible if wrapped in a transaction (depends on DB engine).
  - Triggers: Can activate triggers if defined

  Syntax : -

  DELETE FROM YourTableName; 
  
  DELETE FROM YourTableName WHERE condition


DROP : -

> DROP command is use to parmently delete the table or Database

- Effect: Completely removes the table and its data from the database.
- Can Use WHERE Clause: ❌ No — it removes the whole object.
- Rollback: Not always possible — often irreversible.
- Triggers: Not fired — the object is gone

Syntax : -
 
 DROP TABLE table_name;

>	LEFT JOIN  : JOIN all rows from left table, and matched rows from right table. If data is not match
				 then we get left table rows with NULL for columns from right table.

>	RIGHT JOIN : JOIN all rows from right table, and matched rows from left table. means this is opposite of LEFT 
				 JOIN. If data is not match then we get right table rows with NULL for columns from left table

>	FULL JOIN  : JOIN rows when there is a match in either left or right table unmatched rows will show up with NULL 
				 here there's no match.
